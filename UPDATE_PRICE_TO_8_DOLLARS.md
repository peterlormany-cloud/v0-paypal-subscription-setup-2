# Update Subscription Price to $8

Your PayPal subscription plan is set to $8.00/month, but the website still shows $19.99. Here's what needs to be updated:

## What to Change

The website currently shows:
- Monthly Subscription: $19.99/month
- One-Time Payment: $19.99

Since your PayPal plan is $8/month, you should update the display price.

## Update Website Prices

Update the prices in `app/page.tsx` to match your actual PayPal plan pricing.

**Current prices in code:**
- Subscription: $19.99/month
- One-time: $19.99

**Should be:**
- Subscription: $8.00/month (matches your PayPal plan)
- One-time: $8.00 (or whatever you want for one-time)

Let me know if you want me to update the prices in the code to match!
